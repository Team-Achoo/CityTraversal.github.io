## Synopsis
In this game, the player plays as a crane operator, contracted to move a statue from one end of the city to another. To maximize their payout, the player must minimize the damage they do to the city while safely delivering the statue to its destination. This job will not be easy, everything in this city is fragile and expensive, anything from birds, cars and buildings will become obstacles between the player and their payday.
